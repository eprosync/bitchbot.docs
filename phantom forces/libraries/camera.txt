Camera - A library for making your eyes bleed
- Note:
- Camera system uses ObjectLinker, to see more functions, please decompile the game
- and look for FixedCamera, FreeCamera, MainCamera, MenuCamera and SpectateCamera for more info

type Cameras = FixedCamera | FreeCamera | MainCamera | MenuCamera | SpectateCamera

camera:getTypes(): Cameras[] | {[index: string]: Cameras}
- gets a dynamic table of camera types & objects

camera:getEventTypes(): string[] | {[index: string]: true}
- gets a list of namings used for event calls of each camera type

camera:getType(): string
- gets the current camera type

camera:isType(type: string): boolean
- checks if the current camera type matches

camera:getActive(): Cameras
- gets the current active camera

camera:setActive(type: string)
- sets the current active camera type

#Events
- all events can be connected to via library:connect(name: string, callback: function, identity?: string): EventConnection
- for more information please see documentation under "events"

- !!!Each camera has it's own event!!!
- ex: preFixedStep & preMainStep

pre...Step(): nil
- called before the camera's step

post...Step(): nil
- called before the camera's step
- this perfect for overriding camera movement just after
